# DC Heroes Project

Welcome to the DC Heroes project\! This repository contains a full-stack application with a user interface built using **Angular** and a backend API built with **Node.js** and **Express**. Both services are configured to run within Docker containers for easy setup and deployment.

## Project Structure

* `/frontend`: The Angular application for the user interface.
* `/backend`: The Node.js/Express backend API.
* `docker-compose.yml`: A Docker Compose file to orchestrate and run both the frontend and backend containers together.

## Getting Started with Docker

To run this entire project, you'll need to have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

* **Docker Desktop**: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

Requirements

- Angular 19
- Node.js >= 20.x
- The Justice League microservice.
  - Download the micro-server repository [here](https://github.com/Batega21/justice-league-microservice).
  - Read the `README.md` file for installation and run the microservice.

### Run the project

1. **Build and run the containers**:
    From the root directory of the project, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will:

      * Build the Docker images for both the frontend and backend services.
      * Create and start the containers.
      * Mount the local source code into the containers, allowing for **live-reloading** during development.

## Description

The Justice League application uses **Angular 19** for its structure and components, **Angular Material** for a cohesive UI, and **NgRx** for predictable state management using the **SignalStore**, ensuring separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

## Application Structure

The application employs a modular structure, organizing code into distinct, manageable units. This approach enhances maintainability, scalability, and overall code organization.

## The State management

The state management is based on the SignalStore's NgRx API.
